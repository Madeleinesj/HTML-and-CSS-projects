HTML and CSS Projects

These are a few websites I made while studying HTML and CSS at The Tech Academy.

Projects:
      London Tours Site,
      Movie Theatre Site
     
Space Station site:
This page is an example home page for a travel tour company in London. It is styled with CSS and contains a navbar, image containers and a form. 

Movie Theatre Site:
This page is an example home page for a Movie Theatre that is styled using Bootstrap4. It contains a navbar, jumbotron, form, cards, dropdowns and many more bootstrap4 components.
